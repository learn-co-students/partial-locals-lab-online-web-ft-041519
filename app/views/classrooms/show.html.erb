Classroom Info
<%= render partial: "classrooms/classroom", locals: { classroom: @classroom } %>

Students Info
<% @classroom.students.each do |s| %>
    <%= render partial: "students/student", locals: { student: s } %>
<% end %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: "students/student", locals: { student: @classroom.oldest_student } %>
